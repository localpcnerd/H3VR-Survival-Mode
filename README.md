# SURVIVAL MODE
Survival, a new gamemode for H3. You've been stranded and nobody is coming. How long can you survive?

## FEATURES
 - *Infinite* wave-based gameplay
 - Custom shops for weapons, ammo, attachments, grenades, etc
 - Recyclers to sell off all your unwanted guns, mags, and other goodies
 - Limited/Unlimited ammo modes to dictate your play experience
 - Persistent highscore saving
 - **Boss waves**

## MAPPING
-*Where's the SDK?*

**I am holding off on publically releasing the mapping SDK as I am in the middle of a couple major rewrites that would complicate the mapping proccess for other mappers.** 

I plan on releasing the mapping SDK **in late December-early January.**

Once these rewrites are done, you'll be able to make your map and everything will auto update on its own, no assistance required.

### TODO (BY PRIORITY)
 - **Finish the shops rewrite to allow for custom weapon lists**
 - **Release mapping SDK**
 - *Wrist tracker for stats*
 - *Custom non sosig bosses (ex. Attack choppers)*
