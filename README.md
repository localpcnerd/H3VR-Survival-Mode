# SURVIVAL MODE
Survival, a new gamemode for H3. You've been stranded and nobody is coming. How long can you survive?

## MAPPING

 - Import Atlas [(Available here)](https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/AtlasSampleScenes/) into your Meatkit project.
 - Import the survival mapping package into a Meatkit project.
 - Open the example scene and copy all the objects under the --SURVIVAL-- object into your scene.
 - Reposition and tweak settings to your liking
 - Build as an Atlas sandbox scene.
 - If you have any questions, feel free to DM or ping me @reallocal

### NOTES + TIPS
 - Make sure that Survival_Mode is added as a dependency!!
 - Shops will autofill the item's text field with the name and price you filled out, so you don't need to set those manually. This includes the Ammo Supplier and Randomized Spawner.
 - You can have as many or as little shops as you want, there is no ceiling on the number. I typically stick with 3 split between Weapons, Attachments, and Consumables.

### TODO
 - Wrist follower to display the minimap, various counters/data, etc etc.
 - Rewrite shop spawners to allow for custom vaulted weapons.
 - Some other cool stuff probably.
